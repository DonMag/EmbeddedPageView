# EmbeddedPageView

Swift 4 example of embedding a UIPageViewController in a ContainerView

Also demonstrates using buttons in the "root" view to programmatically change the current "page"

**Note:** This is a demo / example only, and uses hard-coded values (which we would never do in an actual app).
